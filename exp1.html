<p>When you hear the world friends, all we remember is good memories, happy times and a roller coaster of emotions. We have all had friends in various stages of our life, right from kindergarten to middle school to high school to college and university level.  Friendship has no geographical or chronological boundaries and you can make friends at any point of time in your life. Friendship is probably the only bond in the world that is pure without any obligations and strings attached.</p>
